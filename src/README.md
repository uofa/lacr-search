LACR Search is Ruby on Rails web application that provides a convenient way to search within a corpus of transcribed documents stored in XML format. 

A primary goal for LACR Search is to contribute to the [Aberdeen Burgh Records Project](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/riiss/about/aberdeen-burgh-records-project-97.php) with user-friendly interface for easy navigation between pages, volumes as well as to enable search queries.

Plain text search, suggestions, autocomplete, spelling variants are provided utilising the utilising the search engine [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch).

LACR Search has been further extended with the ability for further analysis of the XML documents by providing support for [XQuery](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xquery_intro.asp) expressions utilising [BaseX](http://basex.org/products/).
